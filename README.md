# RSS to Telegram

A Cloudflare Worker service that automatically fetches RSS feed updates and sends them to a Telegram channel.

## Features

- Automatically checks RSS feeds for new content
- Filters items published within the last 24 hours
- Sends new articles to a specified Telegram channel
- Prevents duplicate posts by tracking previously sent items
- Scheduled to run hourly via Cloudflare Workers cron triggers
- Provides a manual update endpoint for on-demand checks

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) (Cloudflare Workers CLI)
- A Telegram Bot Token (create one via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- A Telegram Channel where the bot is an administrator

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure your environment variables in Cloudflare Dashboard or using wrangler secrets:
   ```
   wrangler secret put RSS_FEED_URL
   wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
   wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID
   ```

## Environment Variables

- `RSS_FEED_URL`: The URL of the RSS feed you want to monitor
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token
- `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID`: Your Telegram channel ID (including the @ symbol for public channels)

## Development

Run the service locally for development:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server with the Wrangler CLI.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

## Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```
npm run deploy
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Health check endpoint that confirms the service is running
- `GET /check-updates`: Manually trigger an update check and send new items to Telegram

## How It Works

1. The service runs on a schedule (every hour by default)
2. It fetches the latest items from the configured RSS feed
3. It filters out items that were published more than 24 hours ago
4. It checks which items have already been sent to avoid duplicates
5. New items are formatted and sent to the Telegram channel
6. Successfully sent items are marked as processed in KV storage
